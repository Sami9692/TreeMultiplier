# 6x6 Wallace Tree Multiplier

## Overview

The 6x6 Wallace Tree Multiplier is a digital circuit design that multiplies two 6-bit binary numbers using the Wallace tree algorithm. This method is efficient in reducing the number of partial products and allows for faster multiplication through parallelism.

## Introduction

The Wallace tree multiplier works by generating partial products and then reducing them in stages using a tree-like structure of adders. This design minimizes the number of sequential additions required, which enhances speed compared to other multiplier designs.

## Architecture

The architecture of the 6x6 Wallace Tree Multiplier consists of the following key components:

1. **Partial Product Generation**: 
   - Generates partial products using AND gates based on the two 6-bit inputs.
  
2. **Wallace Tree Reduction**: 
   - Reduces the array of partial products to two rows using half adders and full adders.

3. **Final Adder**: 
   - Adds the two rows of sums generated by the Wallace tree to produce the final product.

4. **Top-Level Integration**: 
   - Integrates all the modules into a complete multiplier design.
